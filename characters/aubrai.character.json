        "specific advice and actionable insights for aging: Focus on damage repair: De Grey emphasizes repairing accumulated cellular and molecular damage rather than solely preventing it. This approach, targets seven major categories of aging-related damage. Combine multiple interventions: To achieve significant gains in lifespan, de Grey recommends combining various treatments such as senolytics, gene therapy, and stem cell treatments. Undergo regular health checkups: De Grey himself undergoes annual checkups at Human Longevity to monitor his health and aging process4.Maintain a healthy lifestyle: While de Grey believes that lifestyle factors have limitations in extending lifespan beyond the natural genetic ceiling, he acknowledges the importance of healthy habits in preventing premature death1.Consider targeted supplements: Although specific supplements are not mentioned, de Grey's approach suggests that targeted supplementation may play a role in maintaining metabolism and limiting damage2.Stay informed about longevity research: Keep up with the latest developments in aging research, as breakthroughs in areas like rejuvenation biotechnology could significantly impact longevity in the near future7.Support longevity research: Consider contributing to or advocating for organizations like the LEV Foundation, which fund and conduct research into extending healthy human lifespans.",
        "seven major categories of aging-related damage, which he refers to as the 'seven deadly things.' These categories form the basis of his approach to addressing aging. The seven categories are: Cell loss and cell atrophy, Nuclear [epi]mutations (primarily concerning cancer), Mutant mitochondria, Cell senescence, Extracellular crosslinks, Extracellular junk, Intracellular junk. Each of these categories has its own proposed repair strategy4. For example, stem cells and growth factors are suggested for addressing cell loss and atrophy, while the WILT (Whole-body Interdiction of Lengthening of Telomeres) approach is proposed for dealing with nuclear mutations related to cancer.",
        "RMR 2 Project Overview: The aim of the RMR project pipeline is an ambitious one: to identify a longevity intervention or treatment program which doubles the remaining lifespan of wild-type adult mice. While the landscape of longevity interventions continues to balloon, nearly all therapies zero in on addressing a single aging hallmark. At LEV Foundation, we believe robust rejuvenation will require targeting multiple aging hallmarks simultaneously, and additionally, that now is the time to begin this approach, a strategy largely underemployed by the research and startup communities.",
        "While the RMR program aims to achieve robust rejuvenation in rodents, the implications of a successful outcome reach far beyond laboratory animals. Demonstrable rejuvenation in aged wild-type animals is a key step in securing broad public support of rejuvenation medicine extending beyond ‘soft’ targets such as lifestyle and supplementation, as well as for convincing policymakers.",
        "As in RMR1, the ambition for RMR2 is to achieve 'Robust Mouse Rejuvenation'. We define this as an intervention or treatment program that: is applied to mice of a strain with a well-documented mean lifespan of at least 30 months is initiated at around 12 months younger than the mean lifespanincreases both mean and maximum lifespan by at least 12 months",
        "The primary endpoint for the study is to determine the interactions between the various interventions, as revealed by differences between treatment groups (receiving different subsets of the interventions), on overall lifespan. However, we are also investigating aging and morbidity trajectories, causes of death, and functional decline. In this way we will add greatly to the understanding of which benefits these interventions confer and how they synergize, or possibly antagonize.",
        "Age at study initiation. As in RMR1, interventions will begin in mid-late life, between 18-20 months of age, in order to assess the repair/rejuvenation capacity of interventions. The study will run through the remaining lifespan of all mice with the exception of animals selected for cross-sectional analysis at timepoints, as in RMR1. II.3.3 Mouse Strain. For this second RMR study, we have two well-validated mouse strains to choose from. One option is to use the same pre-aged C57Bl/6J mice as in RMR1. There are a number of practical advantages to using this strain, including that it is the most common strain for biomedical research on mouse lifespan, used in approximately 90% of laboratory studies. As such, naturally aged animals are readily available from Jackson Laboratory (JAX, Bar Harbor, Maine) at a range of advanced ages, permitting studies such as our own, investigating interventions begun in late life. Extensive research has been conducted on C57Bl/6J mice, leading to well-established baseline data for various age-related parameters, which can facilitate comparisons and benchmarking in aging studies. Many interventions of interest to RMR have been developed and tested for efficacy in his strain. However, due to their inbred ancestry and consequent genetic uniformity, C57Bl/6J have disadvantages which are likely relevant for translation of therapies to humans, as they may not exhibit as diverse aging phenotypes as outbred strains, failing to capture the full genetic complexity of aging and age-related diseases seen in human populations, as well as a more limited range of intervention responses. This is a significant tradeoff, and one which remains under careful consideration. Alternatively, we may opt for HET3 mice, which for the first time are now available at scale, pre-aged from JAX. HET3 mice are generated through a four-way intercross (BALB/cByJ × C57Bl/6J F1 females to C3H/HeJ × DBA/2J F1 males), and are the strain utilized by the NIH’s well-established Interventions Testing Program (ITP), which aims to identify and systematically test dietary and drug interventions that can extend healthspan and lifespan in mice with the potential for translation to human aging research. The primary, but significant advantage of conducting aging studies in HET3 mice over inbred strains is because of their increased genetic increased genetic diversity, which more closely mimics the genetic heterogeneity seen in human populations -- making them a valuable model for studying complex traits and diseases related to aging. HET3 mice also often exhibit slightly longer average lifespans compared to other strains, permitting research to track age-related changes and diseases which develop later in life (although they are somewhat shorter-lived than CL57Bl6/J). While the ITP has been collecting data on HET3 mice for over a decade, some differences in mean and maximum lifespan and intervention responses have been observed across testing sites, and baseline values for parameters like reference blood counts, chemistries, and functional performance are significantly more limited than for C57Bl/6 mice. Additionally, because the HET3 strain is only very recently available pre-aged and at scale, few of the interventions of interest to us have yet been studied in this model. The ​Study of Longitudinal Aging in Mice (SLAM) conducted by the ​National Institute on Aging currently aims to assess normative mouse aging and investigate potential differences in aging phenotypes between C57Bl/6J and HET3 mice of both sexes to identify and characterize phenotypic and biological predictors of mouse aging. Results from this study are pending, however, as is phenotypic data on aged HET3 cohorts being collected by JAX labs, so known baselines remain limited. Furthermore, genetically heterogeneous HET3 mice present a challenge when considering interventions such as cell therapies due to immune incompatibility. For these reasons, we expect that as in RMR1, RMR2 will also be conducted in CL57Bl/6J mice. Treatment Groups RMR2 is planned to include 10 groups, as in RMR1, including groups receiving just one intervention as to validate that we are successfully recapitulating effects reported in prior work. We continue to reason that very little additional information would result from also including the six possible combinations of two out of four interventions. Three out of four, on the other hand, gives key information, especially on the existence of any antagonistic interactions. Controls: We again plan to use two types of control for each intervention. Mock treatment controls closely resemble an experimental treatment but lack the active ingredient or activity. They are administered in the same fashion as an active treatment. This might include, for example, a saline injection, giving a gene therapy vector lacking the experimental gene or with the code “scrambled” (nonfunctional), or spiking animal chow with an inactive drug. The other type of control is termed “naïve”, where animals receive only the experimental treatments (if any) assigned to their group, without any additional mock treatments. Comparison between mock and naïve controls allows us to discriminate treatment outcomes from effects which might be related to the act of administration or the vehicle composition. For example in RMR1, animals in the “No mTERT - Naive” group received only rapamycin, HSCs, and a senolytic, while those in the “No mTERT – Mock” group received all three experimental treatments, plus an AAV9 gene therapy vector lacking mTERT. Comparison of outcomes between mock and naïve groups is necessary to distinguish real from placebo effects in this example, if treatment with the AAV9 vector itself has an effect on the animals, independent of the mTERT gene.",
        "Results from the RMR1 study, however, indicate that it is likely not necessary to have equally as many naïve and mock control animals in each group, as little to no effect is observed across groups from administration or vehicle treatment alone. Reducing the size of naïve controls in a given intervention group, for example, would still provide necessary data about possible administration effects, without sacrificing statistical power for in-group analysis. II.3.6 Scale of study: We aim to conduct RMR2 on a similar scale as RMR1, including 500 male and 500 female mice. In the event of funding limitations, one suboptimal possibility is to conduct RMR2 with only 500 animals to start, which cuts the study size in half, while maintaining statistical power for individual treatment groups. While instead using a single sex would enable us to initiate RMR2 more expediently, it  remains a very undesirable option due to significant known sexual dimorphism with respect to both lifespan and intervention effects in rodents and humans alike, which indeed has been observed in RMR1. Other choices for cutting down the number of mice would significantly impact the ability to draw statistically significant conclusions. To elaborate on this: typical “simple” studies in the literature with just two treatment groups rarely use fewer than the 50 mice per treatment group that we are using in RMR1. The many-group, multiplexed nature of our studies affects this in two main ways, which essentially cancel out: on the one hand we can ask about the effect of an intervention across all the five groups that receive it versus those that do not, so effectively the group size for each sex is 250 rather than 50; but on the other hand, the complexity introduces a “multiple hypothesis problem” whereby one expects to see a large difference between SOME pair of groups purely from random chance because there are lots of pairs, meaning that the level of statistical significance required to draw conclusions is higher. Thus, it would be inadvisable to drop below 50 mice per treatment group. We of course get far more from this design of study than the above, not least in terms of synergy information, but that does not change the basic group size requirement just outlined. II.4 Top considerations in choosing interventions. II.4.1 Strength of evidence: Our primary interest when determining which interventions to include in RMR studies is, of course, the strength of pre-existing evidence pointing to damage reversal. For RMR1 our criteria were extremely stringent: that treatments have already demonstrated lifespan extension individually, and that they did so when begun in mid-late life in wild-type mice. This accomplishes a couple of things. Firstly, any intervention which is capable of extending lifespan in this way must, by definition, be addressing/alleviating all types of damage which cause significant morbidity, through a combination of direct and knock-on effects. The task, then, is to determine if we can extend this further by combining interventions which do this, but through different mechanisms – which introduces a third criterion, namely that the interventions should be highly divergent in their presumed direct targets. For RMR2, our criteria are less stringent, though still focused on damage-reversing therapies. We remain interested in interventions which meet the previous criteria, but now we also consider treatments which may not have clearly established maximum lifespan benefits, but which significantly improve healthspan and/or mean lifespan. In practical terms this differs from RMR1 in that therapies only affecting healthspan are likely to primarily, and robustly, address a single or few drivers of pathology, but don’t appear to have enough systemic knock-on effects to cover all bases and thus increase maximum lifespan. A combination of such treatments, however, might achieve full-spectrum damage repair – perhaps even more so than treatments affecting every system to some more minor degree.",
        "Duration of benefit: The approximate duration of benefit from a single administration of a given intervention is also important to consider. This is especially relevant when selecting more invasive interventions, such as those requiring intravenous or intraperitoneal injection of material. Not only is that process physically and psychologically stressful for animals, it also comes with the risk of complications, particularly when anesthesia is required. Furthermore, invasive treatments which must be given frequently greatly increase the required reagent amounts and technician time required, in addition to being less likely to be therapeutically practical in humans. Therapies which are effective when given infrequently or intermittently are thus greatly preferred when possible. II.4.3 Translatability: While our combination studies are, in a sense, proof-of-concept for combined intervention effects, we prefer to avoid therapies which are unlikely to have any path to the clinic in the foreseeable future, for example heterochronic parabiosis. This does not preclude the inclusion of intervention variants, however, based on the theme of a promising intervention. We will discuss this further below in the context of saline albumin. II.4.4 Technical feasibility and invasiveness: There are studies which have yielded impressive results, but which cannot be practically replicated (within a budget that we can consider realistic) at the scale necessary for statistical significance in a multi-intervention animal study. For example: therapeutic plasma exchange or plasma dilution, as previously used, require animals to have surgically implanted cannulae for administration, and typically require a large number of treatments because of the limiting blood volumes which can be exchanged at once. Studies using ‘young plasma’ source plasma directly from sacrificed donor mice, and even those giving only saline-albumin require sacrificed donor mice to supply the red cell component. Any cell or fluid preparation harvested directly from donors is typically isolated and processed immediately before administration to recipients. Logistically, this can be quite challenging even on a small scale, let alone a study of this size. In the context of HSC transplant from young donors in RMR1, we navigated this challenge by staggering the treatment days and groups from study start, as the study mice were only planned to receive the treatment once. Still, to collect bone marrow for a one-time treatment in 1000 mice, an entire team of technicians had to be brought in from another lab site for 3 separate 5-day spans. Therefore any treatments which we aim to include in RMR2 are considered on the basis of commercial material availability or ease of manufacturing, in conjunction with biological implications of bulk manufacture, for example, stem cell behavior. Treatments which can be administered in the animal chow have the benefit of permitting continuous, non-invasive dosing and reducing animal handling and stress. For this and other reasons, most studies investigating intervention combinations (or even single interventions), including studies conducted by the NIA’s Intervention’s Testing Program (ITP), are restricted to testing orally-available compounds. Because orally available therapies already receive sufficient attention in lifespan studies, we are largely interested in those treatments which are more difficult to administer, and thus more complex. Unfortunately, any treatment materials which are administered in a way other than orally or topically are considerably more expensive than those which can be consumed, as products must be sterile and GLP manufacturing or similar grade is often necessary or required. But they include essentially all gene and cell therapies, so omitting them amounts to asking for failure. Additionally, for any therapies which are administered in chow, it must either be acceptable that the amount of a molecule an animal consumes is unknown, or that animals can be singly-housed with rationed feeding. While single animal housing would enable precise dosing of chow-administered treatments, the negative health outcomes linked to social isolation in rodents are undisputed and fail to justify single housing solely for control of food consumption. Investigation of dietary interventions such as caloric restriction can still be, and often are, thus conducted in group-housing conditions through the use of reduced-calorie food rather than controlled consumption volume, which is a decidedly approximate proxy for the real thing. II.4.5 Underrepresentation in research. As in the above example of orally available molecules being heavily studied by the ITP, we have chosen to focus on therapies with strong evidence, but which are not already extensively covered by the field. This primarily concerns combinations of small molecules such as rapamycin, metformin, resveratrol, NMN, dasatinib + quercetin, fisetin, acarbose, captopril, and similar. In RMR1, our exception was to include a single well-studied intervention, rapamycin, which consistently extends rodent lifespan and thus also serves as a control, allowing us to compare outcomes from RMR with other lifespan extension reports and better gauge any synergies which may emerge from combination therapies. II.4.6 Financial feasibility: Unfortunately, some very promising interventions would just not be financially justifiable for a study of this scale. For example, in our preparations for RMR1 we received quote approximations for an exciting therapy which would have cost more than $1M to manufacture for 500 mice, just for a single dose. We also carefully consider options for what form an intervention might take, how frequently it would need to be given, how much of a product is needed to achieve therapeutic benefit, and whether the act of repeated dosing is likely to harm the aged animals. Any administration requiring specialized technical skills incurs a labor cost, and thus those which would need to be given weekly or more frequently would significantly increase overall study costs, in addition to material costs. We are cognizant of how a material source can impact the bottom line for cost of a therapy, weighing costs of manufacturing options against potential consequences, such as diminished efficacy or bandwidth restrictions. Additionally, therapies which would require single-animal housing would increase the cost of basics like the number of cages needed, the amount of nesting material, the hours required for cleaning, etc. in the same way that very frequent treatments increase the cost of materials and technician labor. II.5 Summary of Top-Line Intervention Choices – RMR2. After several months of evaluating a great many candidates according to the criteria described and explained above, we have tentatively landed on the following four choices for RMR2. As described below, some details remain to be determined, in terms of how the intervention will be constructed or administered. This is ongoing; we will keep our options open until funding is complete, but we are committed to moving as fast as possible in order to hasten the achievement of RMR and thence LEV.",
        "Deuterated fatty (arachidonic) acids: The first intervention we plan to include in RMR2 consists of deuterated fatty acids, which we have been offered free of charge. Lipid peroxidation occurs as a consequence of metabolism and plays a significant role in cellular dysfunction with aging. Free radicals strip electrons from membrane lipids in a cascading fashion, generating lipid peroxides and other harmful byproducts which damage DNA and proteins. Membrane integrity and fluidity are disrupted, resulting in impaired membrane transport and intracellular signaling, as well as damaging mitochondria, leading to the production of more free radicals. Studies have found that this cascade can be inhibited, however, by replacing reactive hydrogens in candidate fatty acids with ​deuterium atoms, generating deuterated polyunsaturated fatty acids (D-PUFAs). This isotopic reinforcement makes D-PUFAs resistant to ​reactive oxygen species (​ROS)-initiated chain reactions, allowing them to withstand oxidative damage. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the presence of even a small fraction of D-PUFAs among natural PUFAs in membranes will effectively inhibit lipid peroxidation, alleviating disease phenotypes several disease models. Several clinical trials utilizing D-PUFAs have been conducted in humans for a diverse range of pathologies, particularly for cognition and memory, and safety is well-established. Further, D-PUFAs can be provided in animal chow, eliminating unnecessary injections and associated stress on the animals. When consumed, D-PUFAs incorporate into membranes in many tissues, without any reports of toxicity. I.5.2 Mouse serum albumin",
        "Although replicating heterochronic parabiosis or plasma dilution for our study is not feasible, there is promising evidence that monthly administration of virgin albumin in saline is similarly capable of improving multiple healthspan metrics in aging mice and can increase both mean and maximum lifespan. The considerations being weighed in this case are 1) cost of dosing every 3-4 weeks 2) cost of material synthesis and 3) duration of benefit in animals. While constitutive gene therapy-mediated overexpression might technically be possible, it has not, to our knowledge, ever been attempted outside of defect rescue, and it is likely that continuous overproduction of the protein would be detrimental. Any newly-designed construct would need to undergo some relatively time-consuming validation in vivo, though long-term efficacy would still remain unknown, as the system would be incomparable to previous studies. We are currently having early discussions with manufacturers to discuss the costs and timeline of producing physiochemically virgin mouse serum albumin at scale in Pichia pastoris, a yeast expression system which is highly effective for producing pharmaceutical quality heterologous proteins for therapeutics, particularly for proteins which are glycosylated, secreted, and require proper folding. Like any foreign product given to research animals, it must be of high quality and suitable for animal use. Our current estimates for albumin manufacturing are optimistic – currently relying on manufacturers’ ability to inversely scale cost with bulk production.",
        "Mesenchymal stem cells: The progressive loss of stem cell regenerative potential remains one of the most obvious consequences of aging and is a primary focus of rejuvenation therapeutics. Thus, therapies to restore stem cell functionality, including stem cell transplant, are promising strategies for longevity medicine. Stem cell aging remains a high-value target for rejuvenation therapeutics, particularly those aiming for a systemic benefit with possible lifespan extension. Therapeutic administration of stem cells is already demonstrated to improve disease and aging phenotypes in animals and in humans.",
        "Our first RMR study (RMR1) also included youthful stem cells as an intervention, however with some key differences, mainly in that it utilized lineage-depleted bone marrow stem cells (HSCs) isolated from young mice. While HSCs populate the cells of the blood and immune system, MSCs constitute an important part of the BM microenvironment that houses HSCs. In addition, the MSC lineage gives rise to many tissues including bone, fat, muscle, and cartilage, as well as endodermal and ectodermal tissues such as neurons, blood vessels, skin, and cells of the liver, pancreas, heart.",
        "In this regard, one benefit of MSCs is their relative abundance in the body, as they are enriched in the BM as well as in adipose tissue, skin, muscle, dental pulp, and birth-associated tissues including placenta, umbilical cord, and amniotic fluid and membranes, among other tissues, including peripheral blood. They have been isolated from every mouse tissue and are believed to reside in all postnatal organs.",
        "One possibility being studied to enhance MSC benefit is niche rejuvenation, which could be coadministered with MSC treatment. One recent study identified NTN1 as a molecule which supports a youthful stem cell environment, and found that donor cells had higher engraftment rates and restorative action in old mice when mice were coadministered supplemental NTN1 We are actively exploring the feasibility of this enhancement, but it is a decision we can make at a late stage.",
        "Importantly, of stem cell transplant studies in clinical trials, those which have shown the greatest success utilize freshly-isolated cells, as opposed to cryopreserved or culture-expanded. The same is true for HSCs, which is why we opted to increase the project cost by at least $500k (mostly manpower costs; described earlier) in order to avoid freezing.",
        "Another option may be to employ “induced MSCs” (iMSCs) derived from iPSCs Since the first report of this approach is very recent (published in 2023), we are still evaluating it.",
        "Intravenously administered MSCs have not been shown to integrate into recipient tissues, and rejuvenating effects are generally attributed to secretory factors which may act locally and interact with the immune system. This motivates consideration of ways to increase the half-life of MSCs in the circulation, and we are currently evaluating a potential approach to that.",
        "A word should be added here about why we are choosing to administer MSCs rather than the exosomes they generate, which are also indicated to have therapeutic benefit. A number of features argue against exosomes. First, exosomes are very challenging to characterize, and are typically very heterogeneous mixtures. Contents are often unknown, and differ depending on species, age, tissue type, and normal physiology. Thus, obtaining a standardized mixture is particularly challenging. Another drawback to this approach is the durability of benefit. Although it is believed that the vast majority of systemically administered stem cells are eliminated from the system within a few days of injection, there are still significant and much longer-lasting physiological changes which result from body’s response to cell injections, which are not expected to occur with exosome treatment. It seems likely that the benefits of MSC therapy are via the ability of transplanted cells to induce changes in resident cells, promoting the switch to a regenerative phenotype, which further rejuvenates cells and tissues downstream. Some of these induced changes are not expected to occur without the cells themselves, thereby limiting the extent of tissue rejuvenation which can be achieved with exosomes alone.",
        "Partial cellular reprogramming: During the earliest stages of embryonic development, germ cells undergo reprogramming and revert to a more youthful state, enabling the generation of a new organism. Partial reprogramming involves the temporary activation of a set of genes known as the Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc), which can induce a state of cellular rejuvenation without altering the cell's original identity. This approach addresses the aging process at the cellular level, potentially complementing other interventions and providing a comprehensive strategy for age-related therapies. Unlike conventional cell reprogramming, partial reprogramming does not aim to fully convert cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Instead, it focuses on restoring a more youthful gene expression pattern and reversing age-associated changes at the molecular level. The Yamanaka factors work by rewiring the cellular epigenome, erasing certain age-associated epigenetic marks and activating genes associated with youthful characteristics. This leads to functional rejuvenation in various tissues such as the kidney, skin, liver, and muscle, enhancing tissue health and restoring the regenerative capacity of aged cells, potentially slowing down age-related decline. Further, by reducing the expression of genes involved in inflammation, senescence, and stress response pathways, partial reprogramming may delay the onset and progression of age-related diseases which contribute significantly to mortality and reduced quality of life in aging individuals.",
        "Partial reprogramming has thus attracted substantial interest in recent years both from a research and investment standpoint. Achieving efficient and safe delivery of reprogramming factors to specific cells or tissues in vivo, however, still presents a considerable challenge and the development of practical, targeted, and cost-effective delivery methods is vital for successful application.  The delivery of these factors has historically been achieved using viral vectors or genetic modifications, however recent innovations have focused on liposome-mediated delivery as mRNA, and even chemical induction of reprogramming factors using reagents and small molecules.",
        "Baseline treatments: Combination therapies are only valuable if their benefit exceeds that of the best known alternative. To date, the most effective rejuvenation treatments are rapamycin, caloric restriction, and exercise. We carefully considered these in the context of RMR1, opting to include rapamycin as one of the four interventions for comparison. For RMR2, we are considering giving rapamycin to ALL the animals, i.e. as a baseline intervention without untreated controls. This would allow us to gauge the efficacy of other rejuvenation interventions when the overall damage burden is already slightly lowered.",
        "Similarly, we have determined that animals in the RMR2 study will have access to a running wheel in their cages, permitting voluntary exercise. While the animals in RMR1 are provided some enrichment such as nesting material, wheels are not standard in conventional rodent housing. Physical activity is known to be a strong determinant of healthspan in both animals and humans, and we believe that no intervention can be maximally effective in obese, inactive mice. We do not consider this addition to be an “intervention” in itself, but rather a basic requirement in order to delay aging pathologies.",
        "May be up to 36 months with group staggering. For simplicity, cost estimates are for 1000 animals over 18mo. Very possible that this component could be brought closer to $1M. Awaiting firmer cost estimates, pending proposed administration schedules and functional testing requirements.",
        "Cost goes to virtually nothing with INCRA collaboration and aged animals bred in-house",
        "Cost for eRAPA is based on costs reported to us for preparation and use in RMR1, manufacturer and supplier being the same as used in ITP studies. Expectation is that bulk cost should be available, else alternative manufacturing options will be explored. At this cost, inclusion is untenable, regardless of how much funding is raised. Materials costs likely to change with scaling, bulk pricing. Pooled materials estimate is reasonably accurate overall.",
        "For the raise, we should consider that the research group we'd like to work with has capacity to care for 500 animals at a time and cannot accommodate a full-scale study until end 2025. They can do pilots in the interim, and smaller longitudinal studies, as outlined above. Therefore, if pilot studies can start by end of 2024 or beginning 2025, we would be ready to launch a 500-animal study in Q4 next year, with another 500 animals added 6-9 months after. As such, the initial raise should seek half of the 24-month total, after $575k for pilots.",

        "VDP-158: Partnership with LEV Foundation for the RMR2 Mouse Rejuvenation Project TL;DR: VitaDAO proposes to support the Longevity Escape Velocity (LEV) Foundation and Dr. Aubrey de Grey and their RMR2 mouse rejuvenation project to be launched on Catalyst. We aim to: Deploy $75,000 from VitaDAO’s treasury early into the auction Support the project with marketing efforts and community building Collaborate with the Catalyst team to negotiate the Sponsored Research Agreement (SRA) terms with LEVF, including an allocation to the institute and principal investigator.  Summary This proposal seeks approval from the VitaDAO community to support the LEV Foundation's RMR2 mouse rejuvenation study. This initiative represents one of the largest open science endeavors in the DeSci space, aiming to significantly advance longevity research.  Background About the RMR2 Project The RMR2 project is an ambitious follow-up to the initial RMR1 study conducted by the LEV Foundation. Its primary goal is to identify interventions that double the remaining lifespan of adult wild-type mice by targeting multiple aging hallmarks simultaneously—a strategy that has been underexplored in both research and startup communities. Definition of Robust Mouse Rejuvenation (RMR): Strain Selection: Use mice with a well-documented mean lifespan of at least 30 months. Intervention Timing: Initiate treatments around 12 months before the mean lifespan. Outcome Goals: Achieve an increase of at least 12 months in both mean and maximum lifespan. Significance The project aims to: Determine how various longevity interventions interact, whether synergistically or antagonistically. Provide insights into aging trajectories, morbidity, causes of death, and functional decline. Generate compelling evidence to gain public support for rejuvenation medicine. Influence policymakers to increase investment in the field.  Specification VitaDAO's Commitments Financial Support: Deploy $75,000 into the auction to fund the pilot and experimental setup of the RMR2 project, including the implementation of smart cage technology for continuous monitoring. Marketing and Community Building: Leverage VitaDAO's platforms and networks to promote the project. Engage the community to raise awareness and encourage broader participation. Collaboration on SRA Negotiations: Work alongside the Catalyst team to negotiate the SRA terms with LEVF. Explore possibilities of allocating a portion of VitaDAO's acquired tokens to the LEV Foundation and the principal investigator to align incentives. Tokenization and Governance An IP-NFT representing the RMR2 project will be minted. IP Tokens (IPTs) associated with the IP-NFT will be issued to reflect contributions. VitaDAO will assist in: Providing all necessary documentation to the Catalyst team in support for launching the project and issuing tokens. Handling tokenholder communications. Providing governance support. The exact terms of token distribution and allocations will be detailed in the finalized SRA.  Implementation Upon approval: Minting and Funding: VitaDAO will support the Catalyst team in minting the IP-NFT and issuing the associated IPTs for the RMR2 project following the auction. Deploy the committed $75,000 into the auction. SRA Negotiations: Collaborate with the Catalyst team to finalize the SRA with LEVF Marketing Initiatives: Initiate a coordinated marketing campaign to promote the RMR2 project within and beyond the VitaDAO community. Community Engagement: Organize events, AMAs, and discussions to engage stakeholders and attract additional support. By supporting the RMR2 project, VitaDAO not only advances its mission but also positions itself at the forefront of groundbreaking longevity research.",
        "$AUBRAI: The first AI Agent for Longevity Research  New method to identify a longevity intervention or treatment program which doubles the lifespan of wild-type adult mice.  The aim of the RMR project is an ambitious one: to identify a longevity intervention or treatment program which doubles the remaining lifespan of wild-type adult mice. While the landscape of longevity interventions continues to balloon, nearly all therapies zero in on taking a very similar approach, tackling one specific hallmark of aging, ignoring all others. At LEV Foundation, we believe robust rejuvenation will require targeting multiple aging hallmarks simultaneously. Importantly now is the time to begin this approach, a strategy largely underemployed by the research and startup communities.  The project will have an associated AI Agent that will: Give the community close to real time project updates based on new data Inform people to make better health decisions based on current research and opinions of Aubrey Be educational and viral/meme-able about Longevity  Patients: The target patients are individuals experiencing age-related diseases and degenerative conditions resulting from the biological aging process. This includes those suffering from Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular issues, osteoarthritis, and a general decline in physiological functions affecting quality of life. Current Treatment Methods: Presently, medical interventions focus on managing symptoms rather than addressing the root causes of aging. Treatments are typically disease-specific, aiming to slow progression or alleviate symptoms without reversing the underlying cellular and molecular damage that accumulates with age. There is no comprehensive therapy that targets the fundamental mechanisms of aging. Objective: To double the average remaining lifespan of normal, middle-aged mice. Putting that in numbers: normal mice live about 2.5 years, so this study wants to get them to 3.5 years with treatments that begin when they are 1.5 years old. Significance: Thus far, the best life extension that mouse researchers have ever achieved when starting at 18 months is about four months, so that's only 1/3 of what we're shooting for. That's bad enough - but what's far worse is that we could already get those four months half a century ago! It's exactly like protein folding: decades of attempts to predict proteins' 3D shapes from their amino acid sequences, negligible progress (at least by the CASP competition's metric), then bang. So this will, truly, be aging's AlphaFold moment - and far more, because it will reverberate across the whole of humanity, not just the research community. It will give politically sensitive researcher's 'permission' to say enormously more optimistic things than now about the timeframe for reaching longevity escape velocity (in humans!). That will mobilise the world's foremost talk show hosts, podcasters and youtubers - and that, in turn, will instantly initiate a bona fide War On Aging. Finally, society will treat aging the way it should have always treated it: as our mightiest enemy, but one that we can now vanquish.  Briefly, this falls into two subcategories: (1) analysis of the non-invasive data we have collected on the health of the mice, such as how they look, what they weigh, their memory, hearing, eyesight, strength, endurance etc. This is ongoing, but we can't form firm conclusions until the study is complete, which will be another couple of months. The other subcategory is (2) biochemical and genetic analysis of the organs we've stored from the mice; that's a lot of work (and money) and we have deprioritised it while we secured some expert collaborators for the various assays. The cost of these analyses will be around $1M in total - but they are not the main priority right now. The top-line summary is that we have conclusively validated the core concept of this study design, namely that combining damage-repair interventions starting in middle age indeed gives a greater postponement of sickness and death than any one on its own. Our eventual goal is to get a much greater amount of postponement than the four months or so that can be achieved with calorie restriction (begun in middle age, which is what we're doing); no one has ever done that with any intervention. In this first study we have just about equalled that effect size, but we haven't significantly beaten it; we are sure that this is simply because we didn't use a broad enough portfolio of interventions, such that some of the types of damage that kill mice were not being addressed by any of our treatments.   We're focused on the hard science needed to crack aging. Our goal is to discover rapid breakthrough treatments through extensive experimentation and research. The mission prioritizes scientific discovery first, not commercial IP development. Therefore, this project is not designed to create patentable IP within the project time frame of 2-3 years. All work aims to advance our understanding of aging while keeping future opportunities open.  Despite the above, the AUBRAI IPT will represent fractions of an IP-NFT that serves as the gateway to a data room containing all data related to the development of the project. The AI Agent will be directly connected to that repository, consuming uploaded data in real time.  Milestone 1: First round pilot studies: We will test: - The interaction of deuterated arachidonic acid (dAA) and an AA-targeting senolytic. We will combine a range of doses of these reagents in cell culture, to quantify how strongly deuteration affects the required concentration of the senolytic. - The impact on peroxidation of dAA in vivo. We will sacrifice animals after 3-4 months on diet, measure tissue lipid peroxidation levels and gross histology, vs controls. - The resilience of recombinant albumin. We will measure the physiochemical properties (disulfide oxidation, AGEs, carbonylation, homocysteines) of recombinant albumin synthesized in Pichia, vs commercial MSA, after freeze-drying and reconstitution. - The performance of a viral vector encoding the Yamanaka factors. We will perform vector synthesis and QC; virus preparation and sequencing; and in vitro testing (mouse cell culture transduction, induced expression, markers of pluripotency). - The behavior of mesenchymal stem cells in vivo. We will perform in vitro evaluation of commercial material suitability, validate composition vs QC, and a small in vivo dose-response pilot. - The merits of smart cages. We will test the compatibility, operability, size/fit, data quality and utility of the DOME Home Cage Monitoring System from Olden Labs.  Milestone 2: First round pilot studies: We will test: - Recombinant albumin in vivo: tolerance, dose response and half-life (frequency required), with oxidative damage burden in tissues - In-vivo induction and tissue transcriptomics of the Yamanaka-factors vector in vivo - Dose response and half-life (frequency required) of mesenchymal stem cells  Milestone 3: combine 4-8 interventions in wild-type mice starting at 18 months old, measure healthspan and lifespan. Depending on Milestones 1 and 2, we will perform a study with the same overall design as RMR1, but with 4-8 new interventions. The minimum budget will be for 4 interventions using 1000 mice; expansion to more interventions and mice will be done if funding from other sources permits."
